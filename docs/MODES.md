# Keyboard capture mode comparison

Some capture methods require superuser privileges (`sudo`), for example `pyusb` provides the most accurate keyboard scancode capture, but needs to de-register the device driver for the input method in order to control it directly.

For example usage, please see the [accompanying blogpost](https://wp.finnigan.dev/?p=682).

| Mode     | Platform           | Modifiers  | Paste  | Blocking   | Focus  | Exit     | Permissions            |
|----------|-------------------|------------|--------|------------|--------|----------|------------------------|
| `usb`    | All               | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No  | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No  | Ctrl+ESC | `sudo` / root          |
| `tty`    | Unix/Linux/macOS  | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes | Ctrl+C   | Standard user          |
| `pynput` | All               | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No  | ❌ No       | ❌ No  | Ctrl+ESC | Input monitoring (OSX) |
| `curses` | Unix/Linux/macOS  | ⚠️ Some    | ✅ Yes | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes | ESC      | Standard user          |

For `curses`, modifier support is incomplete but should be good enough to enable working in a terminal. Curses provides a good mix of functionality versus permissions and is therefore the default mode in keyboard-only mode. When running with mouse and video, `pynput` is selected automatically.

A 'yes' in the remaining columns means:

 * **Modifiers**:
Keys like `Ctrl`, `Shift`, `Alt` and `Cmd`/`Win` will be captured. Combinations like Ctrl+C will be passed through.
 * **Paste**:
Content can be pasted from host to guest. Paste text into the console and it will be transmitted char-wise to the HID device
 * **Blocking**:
Keyboard input will not function in other applications while the script is running
 * **Focus**:
The console must remain in focus for input to be recorded (and transmitted over the UART)
 * **Implication**:
You will need to select the best input method for your use case!

**Platform compatibility:**

* **Windows**: `curses` and `tty` modes are not available (they require Unix-specific modules). On Windows, `pynput` is the default for headless mode, but it does not capture keystrokes in the background — focus must remain on the console window for input to be recorded. For reliable headless keyboard capture on Windows, use `usb` mode (requires admin privilege).
* **macOS**: `pynput` requires Input Monitoring permission. `curses` and `tty` work as standard user.
* **Linux**: All modes available; `curses` is the default for keyboard-only mode.

## macOS Command shortcuts for a Windows target

The GUI provides **Options → Mac Command as Windows Ctrl**. It is enabled by
default on macOS and stored in `.kvm_settings.ini` when running from source. A packaged macOS
application stores settings in `~/Library/Application Support/KVM Serial/settings.ini`. While
enabled, both the physical Mac `Command` key and the physical `Control` key are sent as USB
Control, so common shortcuts such as `Command+C`, `Command+V`, `Command+Z`, and
`Command+Click` work on Windows without AutoHotKey. System-level macOS shortcut
macros such as `Command+Tab`, `Command+Space`, and `Command+Q` are intentionally
not translated.

Printable macOS keys are forwarded by their physical position rather than by
the Unicode value produced by the current macOS input source. This keeps the
keyboard and `Command` shortcuts working when macOS uses a Russian or another
non-Latin layout. Select the desired input language separately on the Windows
target; as with a physical USB keyboard, the target OS interprets the HID key
positions using its own active layout.
