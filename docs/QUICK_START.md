## Shopping List
You will need some hardware to get going with `kvm-serial`:

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Bridge chip module** | *CH9329* cable/module, or... <br/> *CH9350L* UC breakout board (if you need to use in BIOS on older machines) |
| **USB-to-UART adapter** | CP2102, CH340, FTDI, etc. — pick up if your bridge module doesn't include one |
| **Video capture card** | Required for live video feed from the remote machine (HDMI or VGA). |

Pre-assembled CH9329 cables (search "CH9329 cable usb" on eBay/AliExpress) include the UART adapter and are the easiest starting point.

CH9350L modules require a separate USB-to-UART adapter: picking up some Dupont jumper wires will be useful to connect these together. You can usually get everything needed for under £30 ($40USD).

Alternately, combined HDMI+USB-serial hardware such as the [NanoKVM-USB](https://wiki.sipeed.com/nanokvmusb) are now coming onto the market: these offer everything you need in a nice package (for slightly more expense). These are a really good option for users who just want convenience, and are supported by `kvm-serial`.

> It's worth noting that the cheapest HDMI to USB capture cards can have significant lag between the input signal and what arrives on your screen. Before spending £5 on an adapter, consider if you would prefer higher performance from an adapter at around a £30-60 price-point.

## Step 1 — Install the software

**Option A: Download a pre-built executable** (no Python required)

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/sjmf/kvm-serial/releases/latest/).

- **macOS:** Right-click → Open on first launch (or run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ./KVM\ Serial.app` on macOS Tahoe and later).
- **Windows:** Click "More info" → "Run anyway" on the SmartScreen prompt.

**Option B: Install from PyPI**

```bash
pip install kvm-serial
python -m kvm_serial        # launch the GUI
```

**Option C: Run directly with `uv`** (no install step)

```bash
uv run kvm-gui
```

**Option D: Install from source** (for bleeding-edge code or development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjmf/kvm-serial.git
cd kvm-serial
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m kvm_serial
```

## Step 2 — Install serial drivers (if needed)

Executables bundle all Python dependencies, but your OS may still need a USB-to-UART driver.

| Platform | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Windows** | Install the driver for your adapter chip (CP210x, CH340, FTDI, PL2303). Check Device Manager → Ports for the COM port after connecting. |
| **macOS** | Most adapters work without drivers. Verify with `ls /dev/cu.*` after connecting. |
| **Linux** | Kernel modules are usually included. Just add your user to the `dialout` group: `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` then log out and back in. |

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for detailed driver download links and instructions.

## Step 3 — Connect the hardware

### CH9329 (simpler — recommended for new users)

1. Plug the **USB-A (HID) end** of the CH9329 cable into the **target machine**.
2. Plug the **serial end** (or USB-to-UART adapter) into your **host machine**.
3. Verify a serial port appears on the host:
   - macOS/Linux: `/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX` or `/dev/ttyUSB0`
   - Windows: `COM3`, `COM4`, etc.

> **Wiring note (DIY modules only):** Connect only TX, RX, and GND between the UART adapter and the CH9329. Do not connect 5 V / VCC — the chip is powered by the target's USB port.

### CH9350L (more capable, needs dipswitch setup)

1. Set the dipswitches on the CH9350L board before connecting:
   - **SEL = 0** (OFF) — configures the module as Upper Computer (UC); kvm-serial emulates the Lower Computer (LC) module.
   - **S0/S1** — select the working state. State 3 is recommended (see table below).
   - **BA0/BA1 = 1/1** — baud rate 115200 (default out of the box).

   | S0 | S1 | State | Use case |
   |----|----|-------|----------|
   | HIGH | HIGH | 0/1 | Full descriptor handshake |
   | LOW | HIGH | 2 | Legacy BIOS/UEFI CSM (relative mouse) |
   | **HIGH** | **LOW** | **3** | **Desktop OS (absolute mouse) — recommended** |
   | LOW | LOW | 4 | Multi-monitor (HID Digitizers) |

2. Connect the UC's **USB-A connector** to the **target machine**.
3. Wire the UC's serial header to your host via a 3.3 V USB-to-UART adapter (TX→RX, RX→TX, GND→GND).
4. Verify the serial port appears on the host (same as above).

> If the target machine does not enumerate ("see") a USB HID device, try the other USB-A port on the UC board.

See [CH9329_GUIDE.md](CH9329_GUIDE.md) and [CH9350L_GUIDE.md](CH9350L_GUIDE.md) for full hardware details.

## Step 4 — Run the GUI

```bash
python -m kvm_serial
```

1. The app auto-enumerates serial ports and video devices.
2. Open **File → Connect** and select your serial port, then click **Connect**.
3. (Optional) Select the video capture card under **Options → Camera**.
4. For CH9350L: open **Options → Protocol** and select the matching CH9350L state, then **Options → Baud → 115200**.
5. Click in the video window — your keyboard and mouse are now forwarded to the remote machine.
6. Use **File → Save Configuration** to persist your settings.

On macOS, enable **Options → Audio → Monitor HDMI Audio** to play audio from
the selected HDMI capture device through the default Mac audio output. macOS
may request Microphone privacy permission because capture-card audio is exposed
as an audio-input device. KVM Serial does not capture the Mac's built-in
microphone for this feature. Audio monitoring uses a separate audio-only
AVFoundation session, so enabling or disabling it does not reconfigure or add
synchronisation buffering to the low-latency video session.

To profile host-side input latency, start the app from a terminal and enable
**Options → Latency Diagnostics**. Every two seconds the terminal reports mouse
event count, coalescing percentage, queue and serial-dispatch p50/p95/max, click,
wheel and keyboard dispatch times, plus the calculated UART time for mouse and
keyboard packets. Diagnostics are disabled by default and do not inspect or copy
video frames. The serial dispatch value measures the call into the operating system;
the UART estimate accounts for the remaining on-wire transmission time.

Sending the Mac microphone to the target is not supported by CH9329/CH9350:
those chips expose keyboard and mouse HID interfaces, not a USB Audio Class
microphone. That direction requires separate USB audio hardware connected to
the target.

## Step 4 (alternative) — Headless / CLI

Use `control.py` when running without a display (e.g. Raspberry Pi, server).

```bash
# CH9329 — basic keyboard forwarding
python -m kvm_serial.control /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX

# CH9329 — with mouse capture
python -m kvm_serial.control --mouse /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX

# CH9350L — absolute mouse, state 3 (recommended for desktop)
python -m kvm_serial.control --ch9350 --ch9350-state 3 /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX

# CH9350L — relative mouse, state 2 (for BIOS/UEFI)
python -m kvm_serial.control --ch9350 --ch9350-state 2 /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX

# Windows COM port
python -m kvm_serial.control COM3

# All options
python -m kvm_serial.control --help
```

The default keyboard capture mode is `curses` (keyboard-only) or `pynput` (when mouse is enabled). See [MODES.md](MODES.md) for a full comparison if you need to change this.

## Troubleshooting

**No serial ports listed**
- Check the driver is installed (see Step 2).
- Linux: ensure you are in the `dialout` group and have logged out and back in.
- Confirm the USB-A HID end is in the **target** machine, not the host. The host needs to talk to the **serial** end of the cable.
- Try unplugging and reconnecting the device!

**No keyboard/mouse response on the target**
- CH9350L: verify SEL = 0 and S0/S1 match your selected state. Power-cycle the board after changing dipswitches.
- CH9350L: confirm baud rate matches the BA0/BA1 dipswitch setting (default 115200).
- Try a different USB port on the target.

**Input not captured on the host (macOS)**
- `pynput` mode requires **Input Monitoring** permission: System Settings > Privacy & Security > Input Monitoring.
- Alternatively, use `--mode curses` or `--mode tty`.

**Linux: permission denied on serial port**

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
# then log out and back in
```
